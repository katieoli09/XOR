# XOR
### Task to find elements in an array using XOR

Steps:
* Define a function to pick out numbers in the array we want to use with a for loop.
* In the case of this code, we want the numbers that are divisible by 10, therefore we set the divisor variable to 10.
* We can then calculate the XOR value for the select numbers in the array and print the result.
